# UTIL-Sec blog

This is a blog I implemented a few years ago using React.js and Next.js as a tutorial code-along from a Youtube video created by JS-Mastery. Back then, I was mostly interested in cybersecurity, and that is why I chose the name UTIL-Sec for this blog.

Now, after two years of studying at the University of Waterloo as a statistics student, I have developed a large interest in data science and machine learning, being the reason for me changing the main function of this blog (but not the name) to a blog where I post my latest activity in my new field of career, machine learning.
